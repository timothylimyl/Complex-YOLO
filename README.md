# Purpose

The purpose of the repository is to gain an understanding of Complex-YOLO and try it out for myself for the purpose of my Final Year Project (FYP). The code repository was taken from [Deepak Ghimire](https://github.com/ghimiredhikura/Complex-YOLOv3). I investigated into the details of the algorithms and reported it here (and in my FYP). Some extra test was also done. Visualisation of Complex-YOLO on KITTI Dataset:
